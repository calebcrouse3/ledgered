"""Defines a plugin which is a class that handles parsing of data from file 
uploads from various 3rd parties and insert file transactions data into the database.

how files are processed
1. Input file is validated against plugins defined input schema
2. Input file is read in row by row and converted into a pandas dataframe
3. Columns from dataframe are translated into master transaction schema
4. Transaction from dataframe are aggregated to remove transaction with duplicate keys
5. Each transaction is converted into a form and checked against the database to see if its already been uploaded,
if not its uploaded into the database
