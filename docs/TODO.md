### Where you left off

### TODO List
- Nail down transaction processing logic. Make a runbook for ledgering!
  - Aggregation
  - Duplication
  - Updating
  - AUTH:
  - Transfers
- cascading dropdowns for subcategories not working because need to get categories only for current user
- ENUMs
  - define and enforce transaction and plugin types
  - single letter versus whole word
- File uploads
  - would be nice to have some error handing for a file upload that only uploads a portions of the transactions.
    - complete versus incomplete
  - Is there a way to fail when processing raw transaction df by only dropping a single row and not the whole data frame?
  - Maybe do everything line by line and without pandas? Even the aggregation? Or maybe just do as little as possible with pandas
- What about using the CSV module for parsing resources?
- Need some sort of message on screen when not entering transaction data correctly

if your jypter notebook cant find the installed packages, run this with the venv activated then select the right kernel
